# Overview

I am looking to always learn and apply new things as a software engineer. I highly enjoy working through problems and using new techniques to work more efficiently.

My program here prints 'Hello World' using python.

I have done this project in an effort to become familiar with GitHub and pushing my work to it. I started from scratch to download and install my development environment. I also included a 'git.ignore' file, so I can see how private information can be used and secured.
